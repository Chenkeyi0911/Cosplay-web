<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The cosplay web site is intended to increase revenue for cosplay by selling cosplay costumes and increasing new and repeat cosplay fans. They can meet new friends which is interested in cosplay here and buy the beat cosplay costumes.&nbsp;The website should help us be more successful at these. Dressing up is fun, good for the socially awkward and very creative.The wed need the site to appeal to a younger audience than this, getting high school kids and young adults cosplaying. There will be more people would come to the parties and get costumes made if they knew about web more.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> Other advertising will be consistent for a period of 3 months (except for including the new web site), so that any increase in sales should be attributable to the site. There will be more people attending parties and more people booking costumes.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>National residents, mostly between the ages of 35 and 50 form the majority of our current audience (most cosplay fans), and this is who the site is aimed at.</p>
